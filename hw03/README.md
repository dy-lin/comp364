# COMP 364: Assignment 3

## Evolutionary Algorithms
In this assignment we're going to practice some more advanced Python concepts. Namely, we'll be working with defining our own classes, and doing some visualization.

We will practice all these things in the context of simulating the evolution of RNA molecules.
